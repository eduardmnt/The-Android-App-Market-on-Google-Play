# The Android App Market on Google Play
A jupyter notebook containing skills in Importing and Cleaning Data, Data Manipulation, Data Visualization and Probability and Statistics. The data source is DataCamp
Plotly package plots are not shown in the notebook, but i uploaded in the readme static images that are missing from the notebook. I chose to keep them as plotly graphs because they are interactive and good looking.
